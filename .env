# Keystone configuration file
#
# This file defines the basic metadata for your book project. Keystone uses it
# to populate document headers, filenames, and publishing settings before building
# your book inside a Docker container.
#
# ➤ Just update the values below — no need to touch internal scripts or hidden files.
# ➤ Everything else (layout, build steps, metadata) is handled automatically.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The name of your project
#
# This is used to name generated artifacts (e.g., keystone.pdf, .epub).
# It should be a simple, lowercase string without spaces or special characters.
#
# Note: This is not the title of your book, but the name of the project.
#
# Example: hello-world
KEYSTONE_PROJECT=keystone

# The cover image for your book
#
# This is the path to the cover image file in your `./assets` folder.
# It should be a valid image format (e.g., PNG, JPG).
#
# The cover image maps to the `epub-cover-image` Pandoc metadata field and is
# available only to EPUB.
#
# Example: ./assets/cover.png
KEYSTONE_COVER_IMAGE=

# The title of your book
#
# This is the main title of your book, which will appear on the cover and in metadata.
# It should be a descriptive title that reflects the content of your book.
#
# Example: Hello World
KEYSTONE_TITLE=Keystone

# The subtitle of your book
#
# This is an optional subtitle that provides additional context or information about your book.
# It will appear on the cover and in metadata. Leave empty if you don't want a subtitle.
#
# Example: The sample book using the Keystone project
KEYSTONE_SUBTITLE=

# The author of your book
#
# This is the name of the author or organization responsible for the book.
# It will appear on the cover and in metadata. You can include multiple authors
# by separating them with commas.
#
# Example: Knight Owl LLC
# Example: Jane Doe, John Smith
KEYSTONE_AUTHOR=Jane Doe

# The date of your book
#
# This is the publication date of your book. It can be a specific date or a keyword.
#
# Accepted values:
# - auto: Automatically set to the current date when building the book
# - disabled: Do not include a date in the book
# - any date representing text, e.g., March 30, 2025
#
# Example: March 30, 2025
KEYSTONE_DATE=auto

# The footer copyright text
#
# This is the copyright text that will appear in the footer of your book.
# It can be a specific text or a keyword.
#
# Accepted values:
# - auto: Automatically set to the current year and author name
# - disabled: Do not include a copyright in the footer
# - any custom text, e.g., © 2025 Jane Doe
#
# Example: © 2025 Jane Doe. All Rights Reserved
KEYSTONE_FOOTER_COPYRIGHT=auto

# A short description of your book
#
# This is a brief description of your book, which will be included in metadata.
# It should be a concise summary of the book's content and purpose.
# It can span multiple lines, but keep it short and to the point.
# Use \n to indicate line breaks.
#
# Example: This is a tribute to beginnings.\n\nIn every language, in every framework, "Hello, world" is the first spark — the moment code speaks back.\n\nThis sample book is your invitation to begin — to build something real, reproducible, and yours.\n\nKeystone turns Markdown into manuscripts, commits into clarity, and books into beautiful, versioned artifacts.
KEYSTONE_DESCRIPTION=

# A comma-separated list of keywords for your book
#
# This is a list of keywords or tags that describe the content of your book.
# They will be included in metadata for indexing or cataloging purposes.
# You can use any keywords that are relevant to your book.
#
# Example: hello-world,keystone,sample,book,inspiration
KEYSTONE_KEYWORDS=

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# PDF layout and typography settings (LaTeX-specific)
# These are passed as `-V` variables to Pandoc when building PDFs.
#
# Reference: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Paper size for LaTeX (PDF only)
#
# This corresponds to LaTeX's `papersize` option (no "paper" suffix).
# Leave empty to use the LaTeX default (usually letter or a4).
#
# Common values:
# - letter     (8.5" x 11", US)
# - a4         (210mm x 297mm, international standard)
# - a5         (148mm x 210mm, compact book size)
# - b5         (176mm x 250mm, used in publishing)
#
# Example: a4
KEYSTONE_LATEX_PAPERSIZE=

# Page geometry (margins) for LaTeX
#
# Use LaTeX geometry syntax: margin=1in or top=20mm, bottom=25mm, etc.
# Leave empty to use the LaTeX default (margin=1in).
#
# Reference: https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry
#
# Common values:
# - margin=1in                                    (default, good for general documents)
# - top=20mm, bottom=25mm, left=20mm, right=20mm  (compact, use with a5)
# - inner=30mm, outer=20mm, top=25mm, bottom=25mm (wider inner margin for binding)
# - margin=10mm                                   (minimal margin — may clip when printed)
#
# Example: margin=1in
# Example: top=20mm, bottom=25mm, left=20mm, right=20mm
KEYSTONE_LATEX_GEOMETRY=

# Base font size for LaTeX document
#
# Accepted values: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
# Leave empty to use the LaTeX default (10pt).
#
# Example: 12pt
KEYSTONE_LATEX_FONTSIZE=

# Font family for the main body text (requires XeLaTeX engine)
#
# Passed as `-V fontfamily=...`, mapped to \setmainfont under the hood.
# Leave empty to use the default LaTeX font (Computer Modern).
#
# Reference: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#fonts
#
# Supported values (confirmed):
#   - libertine    (maps to Libertinus Serif)
#   - palatino     (maps to Palatino)
#   - times        (maps to Times New Roman)
#   - helvet       (maps to Helvetica)

# Docker configuration (advanced users only)

# Docker Compose project name (used to name networks, containers, and volumes)
#
# This defines the Compose project namespace.
# By default, it's prefixed with "keystone-" for clarity and conflict avoidance.
#
# Example: keystone-hello-world → results in network name like `keystone-hello-world_default`
KEYSTONE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROJECT=keystone-${KEYSTONE_PROJECT}

# Docker image name for your project
#
# This is used when building the Docker image.
# By default, it matches the Compose project name — but you can override it
# if you want a custom image tag (e.g., for registries or CI pipelines).
#
# Example: keystone-hello-world:latest
